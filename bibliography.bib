	Abstract = {Web services in automation systems usually use {XML} technology for data exchange functions. Actual Web browsers include {XML} functionality already as standard and therefore they are very promising candidates for implementing monitoring and operating functions of Web services. But Web browsers typically incorporate only a subset of Web technologies and their availability may be characterized by a relatively short live time compared to automation solutions. So many existing libraries for Web based monitoring and operating are implemented with Java and some new versions of browsers do no longer support Java natively. An interesting alternative are {XML-based} graphical user interface languages developed for the office world, but existing languages do not meet the requirements of real time visualization in automation. To overcome these deficiencies this paper presents a new language for Web based monitoring and operating supporting Web services for the data exchange.},

@inproceedings{xvcml-indin2008,
	Abstract = {The {XML} based modeling language of graphical user interfaces for visualization systems in automation, {XVCML,} has been developed to ensure the consistency of visualization solutions in the fast-moving field of consumer technology. Until now, it only provides modeling elements for visualization of real time process data and the necessary communication relationships with data servers. In order to be accepted in practice, {XVCML} also needs modeling components for additional, user defined algorithms. This paper presents an approach to enhance {XVCML} with generic, algorithmic components to perform e.g. simple algebraic operations. For this purpose, Executable {UML} has been used and proven to be suitable. Therefore, Executable {UML} will be introduced and first experiences will be shown by an early prototype which realizes a typical scenario of industrial automation.},
